    <h2  id="notice2">The US Navy recovers an extinct fleet of the Cold War</h2>
    <img src="public/img/image2.jpg" height="400" width="1000">
    <p>The United States Navy has begun the official resurrection of an extinct fleet from the Cold War era
        , which was discarded in 2011 and which is back in the midst of growing tensions with Russia. In May,
         the Navy announced that It was to recover the Second Fleet, which played a key role during the years
          of the Cold War with operations in the North Atlantic and supporting naval forces in the Mediterranean.
           The fleet, which opened in 1950, was dissolved for budgetary reasons. The Second Fleet played a key role
            during the Missile Crisis in Cuba in 1962, when its ships prevented the Soviet ships from reaching the
            island. "This is the dynamic response of the United States and the US Navy to a dynamic security environment,
            "said the head of naval operations, Admiral John Richardson, at a ceremony on board the USS George HW Bush:
            "The Second Fleet will be our spearhead ... for the Atlantic, maintaining the maritime superiority of the 
            United States that will lead to maintaining our security, our influence and our prosperity throughout the 
            world," he added. The national defense strategy of the Donald Trump Administration qualifies China and Russia
            as the biggest threats in the United States and points to its growing assertiveness and search for new weapons
            such as hypersonic missiles and advanced torpedoes. Russian planes and ships have made multiple incursions in 
            the North Atlantic near the airspace and territorial waters of NATO allies, including the United Kingdom.
            The United States Army also announced the official activation of a new command of innovation and preparedness
            to counter new types of weapons developed by Russia and China. It is headquartered in Austin, Texas, and will
            be led by a four-star general with a staff of approximately 500 civilians and military personnel. YOU MAY BE INTERESTED</p>
